haskulator
==========

A calculator web app running on a Haskell back-end, as suggested by "Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming"

> Web forms: calculator in a browser
>
> Using the web forms standard in HTML5, you can build richer interactions,
> particularly using a local web server running in Haskell. In particular,
> you should be able to build a browser-embedded version of the calculator program,
> using Haskell to calculate the value of the input expression, and performing the 
> interaction using a web form. Alternatively, it is possible to build interactivity
> using JavaScript, either “raw” or through the jQuery library.
